## Running locally

To run the code of a specific day, make sure you have Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and from within the repo directory run the following, replacing `XX` with the day number, `01` - `24`:

```sh
go run day_XX/main.go
```

To run the code of all days run the script:

```sh
./run_all.sh
```

Make sure you have ginen permission to execute (`chmod +x run_all.sh`).
