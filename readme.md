## Running the code

To run the code of a specific day, make sure you [have Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and from within the repo directory run the following, replacing `XX` with the day number, `01` - `25`:

```sh
go run day_XX/main.go
```

To run the code of all days run the script:

```sh
./run_all.sh
```

## Linting

```sh
gofmt -s -w .
```

Make sure you have given permission to execute (`chmod +x run_all.sh`).
